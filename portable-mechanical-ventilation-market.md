<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Portable Mechanical Ventilation market comprises two main types: non-invasive and invasive ventilation. Non-invasive ventilation delivers support through masks or nasal interfaces, allowing patients to breathe spontaneously while minimizing discomfort and complications. In contrast, invasive ventilation requires an artificial airway, like intubation, directly connecting the ventilator to the patient's respiratory system, typically used for patients with severe respiratory failure. Both types cater to different clinical needs and patient conditions, driving innovation and development within the healthcare sector.</p></p>
