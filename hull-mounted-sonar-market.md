<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Mounted Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar Type</li><li>Active Sonar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hull-mounted sonar systems are essential for underwater detection and surveillance in naval operations. The market is divided into two main types: passive sonar and active sonar. Passive sonar listens for sounds emitted by underwater objects, making it effective for stealthy operations, as it does not reveal the ship's position. On the other hand, active sonar emits sound waves and analyzes their echoes to detect and locate objects, providing accurate range and positioning data. Both types are critical for maritime security and navigation.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Hull Mounted Sonar Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Mines</li><li>Moored Mines</li><li>Semi-buried Mines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hull mounted sonar systems are essential for naval operations, primarily for detecting and classifying underwater threats, including ground mines, moored mines, and semi-buried mines. Ground mines are located on or buried in the seabed, posing a risk during naval maneuvers. Moored mines are tethered to the sea floor but suspended in the water column, while semi-buried mines are partially embedded in the substrate. Effective sonar applications enable safe navigation and mission planning by identifying these mine types in real-time.</p></p>
