<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pediatric Electronic Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatric electronic ventilator market is categorized into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require the insertion of a tube into the trachea to deliver respiratory support, commonly used in critical care settings for severely ill patients. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, use facial masks or nasal prongs to assist breathing without requiring intubation, making them suitable for conditions like asthma or sleep apnea. Both types are essential for managing respiratory distress in pediatric patients.</p></p>
